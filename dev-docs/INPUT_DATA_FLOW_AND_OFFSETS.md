# Data Input Flow and Offsets

This document summarizes how MyPySkinDose handles RDSR inputs, normalization settings, and patient offsets, and outlines recommendations for how the GUI can better handle these parameters to improve user transparency.

## 1. Original Flow Inputs

MyPySkinDose accepts two primary forms of input data:
- **DICOM RDSR (`.dcm`)**: The standard input format. It runs through `rdsr_parser.py` (extracts tags) and `rdsr_normalizer.py` (standardizes the coordinate space and parameters).
- **Pre-parsed JSON files (`.json`)**: Found in `example_data/RDSR/` (e.g., `beam_collimations.json`, `table_translations.json`). These bypass the parser and normalizer entirely. They are loaded directly into Pandas DataFrames and are primarily used for testing specific geometry and mathematical edge cases.

## 2. Normalization Settings

Different X-ray manufacturers define their reference coordinates differently. `rdsr_normalizer.py` uses `normalization_settings.json` to map these to MyPySkinDose's standardized coordinate system. It matches the RDSR's `Manufacturer` and `ManufacturerModelName` to apply:
- **`translation_offset`**: Shifts the machine's table coordinates to match a standard isocenter.
- **Directional Signs**: Ensures rotations (Ap1, At1, etc.) and translations move the phantom in the correct directions.
- **Field Size Mode & Detector Length**: Ensures beam spread is calculated correctly.

## 3. The "Offset Issue" (Dose Projecting Incorrectly)

If dose projects onto strange parts of the 3D human mesh (e.g., the beam hitting the head during a cardiac procedure), it is usually caused by an offset mismatch:

1. **`settings.phantom.patient_offset` (Most Common)**: In PySkinDose, the `(0, 0, 0)` isocenter of the table corresponds to the head-end of the support table. The `patient_offset` setting (`d_lon`, `d_ver`, `d_lat` in cm) physically shifts the 3D human mesh relative to this table origin. If `d_lon` is set to `0` (the default), the patient's head is flush with the top edge of the table. If the actual patient was positioned lower down, `d_lon` must be changed.
2. **Missing/Incorrect `translation_offset`**: If `normalization_settings.json` lacks an entry for the specific scanner model (or has incorrect coordinates), the table movements will anchor around the wrong spatial origin. For instance, the Philips Allura requires an offset of `{x: -0.3, y: 105.5, z: -173.35}`, while Siemens Artis uses `{x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}`. 

## 4. GUI Improvements for Settings Handling

Currently, settings can be opaque to users running the tool, especially if defaults silently fail to match the reality of the RDSR data. To improve this, the GUI should incorporate the following features:

### A. Explicit Patient Placement (Geometry Preview)
The GUI must surface the `patient_offset` parameters (`d_lon`, `d_lat`, `d_ver`) as interactive sliders or number inputs. 
- **Recommendation**: In "Step 2 — Geometry Preview" of the GUI plan, allow users to adjust these offsets and instantly see the 3D human mesh update its position on the table using the `mode="plot_setup"` or `mode="plot_event"` visualizer. This enables visual verification of the patient's alignment *before* running the lengthy dose calculation.

### B. Manufacturer Normalization Transparency
The GUI should validate the uploaded RDSR against `normalization_settings.json`.
- **Recommendation**: During "Step 1 — Upload RDSR", if the scanner's `Manufacturer` and `Model` are not found in the normalization database, the GUI should display a clear warning: *"Warning: This scanner model is not in the normalization database. Table offsets may be incorrect."* This prevents silent failures where the dose projects incorrectly due to missing machine calibrations. The offsets should also be applied immediately, so that the Geometry tab shows the correct position of the tube and detector relative to the table.

### C. Procedure-Specific Presets
Provide a dropdown for "Procedure Presets" (e.g., Cardiac, Head/Neck, Abdominal). Selecting a preset would automatically populate the `patient_offset` with sensible defaults (e.g., sliding the patient down the table for a cardiac procedure) and select an appropriate `human_mesh`.

### D. Clear Settings Summary
Before hitting "Calculate", present a summary card showing the active phantom model, orientation, and offsets, so users know exactly what geometric assumptions are going into the calculation.
