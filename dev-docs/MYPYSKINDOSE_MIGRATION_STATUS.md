# MYPYSKINDOSE_MIGRATION_STATUS.md

_Date: 2026-04-21_


## Migration Status Summary

**Goal:**
Enable this fork to be published on PyPI **alongside** the original project by renaming the import/package identity from `pyskindose` to `mypyskindose` while preserving upstream attribution and core behavior.


## What Has Been Completed

- **Namespace Migration:**
   - All source code migrated from `pyskindose` to `mypyskindose`.
   - Imports and references updated throughout the codebase.
- **Testing & Validation:**
   - All unit and integration tests pass under Python 3.14.
   - Editable install, build, and PyPI artifact validation (via `twine check`) are successful.
- **Linting:**
   - Linter switched from deprecated `pylama` to `ruff`.
   - All Ruff findings in source files have been fixed (explicit re-exports, unused imports/vars, membership test style, etc.).
- **Project Metadata:**
   - `pyproject.toml` updated (project-urls, dependencies, classifiers).
   - `requirements.txt` updated for dev requirements.
- **Cleanup:**
   - Legacy/unused artifacts (e.g., `src/pyskindose.egg-info`) removed.
- **Final Review:**
   - Ensure all tests, lint, build, and docs workflows are clean and reproducible.
